ANSYS is a computer-aided engineering (CAE) software suite used to simulate, analyze, and design products and systems in various industries such as aerospace, automotive, energy, and healthcare. ANSYS provides a wide range of simulation tools that can be used to model and analyze various physical phenomena such as fluid dynamics, structural mechanics, electromagnetics, and thermal analysis.

The software suite is known for its high level of accuracy and versatility, and is widely used by engineers and designers to optimize product performance, reduce costs, and improve time to market. ANSYS offers a wide range of modules and add-ons, which can be customized to suit specific engineering needs and requirements.
